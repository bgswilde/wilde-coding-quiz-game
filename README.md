# Wilde Coding Quiz Game

## DESCRIPTION
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this site produces quiz questions to test knowledge of JavaScript principles. I used the following techniques in this project:

* HTML and CSS from scratch, with normalize.css used for some fallback styling. 
* Pseudocoding the logic for JavaScript
* Defining variables, functions, and elements for DOM manipulation and interaction.
* Utilizing localStorage for saving high scores.
